This project aims to build a simple email like UI where we can implement the following points

●A login page with a simple form where the user can enter an email and password as
credentials. If the credential matches the mock data, the user gets redirected to the Dashboard page with a list of Emails in his Inbox (data.js file having the list of users)
● Compose mail should open a pop up that allows you to write a simple mail with To and CC fields, subject and a body
● Upon submission, the email should be stored in local storage and should appear in the list of Sent Emails
